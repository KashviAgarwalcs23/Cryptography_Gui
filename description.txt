 here’s a step-by-step guide on how to present it to your professor:

1. Conceptual Overview of the Attack:

Start by explaining the concept of a file integrity attack. In this case, the attack could be a tampering attack where someone tries to modify the original file after it has been signed, but they don't have access to the private key to generate a valid signature for the modified file.

Explain the key points:

Signature Generation: A file is signed using a private key (Lamport’s algorithm), and the signature is tied to the exact content of the file.

Tampering Attack: An attacker modifies the contents of the file (for example, adding a new line or changing some text).

Verification Process: When the file and its signature are verified using the public key, if any change has occurred in the file, the verification will fail because the signature no longer matches the modified content.

2. Demonstrating the Attack (Show the Code in Action):

Here’s how you can visually and practically demonstrate it:

Step 1: Sign the Original File (Clean Version)

File: test.txt (a simple text file with original content).

Action: Use your Lamport signature algorithm to generate a signature for the original file and save it as signature.bin.

Step 2: Tamper with the File

Action: Modify the content of test.txt by changing a word, deleting a line, or adding some text.

For example, change the text from:

This is a test file.
It contains some text for signing.

to:

This is a test file.
It contains modified text for signing.

Step 3: Try to Verify the Modified File

Action: Use your application to verify the signature of the modified file.

Expected Outcome: The verification will fail because the signature was generated based on the original content, and the modified file does not match the original hash.

The verification process compares the hash of the modified file with the hash used in the signature. Since the content is different, the hashes won’t match, and the signature will be deemed invalid.

Logs: In the logs, you will see the warning message: "Signature verification failed at index X." This shows that the file has been tampered with and thus fails verification.

Step 4: Explain What Happens

Key point: Because the Lamport signature is based on a one-time private key for each bit, any modification to the file will result in a different hash, causing the verification to fail.

The Attack’s Outcome: Since the attacker doesn't know the private key, they cannot generate a new valid signature for the modified file. This makes it impossible for them to forge the signature.

Demonstrate the logs: Point out the log messages where the signature verification failed, showing that the modified file doesn't match the signature, which proves the integrity attack failed.

3. Key Concepts to Explain in Your Presentation:

One-Time Key Usage: Emphasize how Lamport signatures use a different part of the private key for each bit in the file, making it very difficult for an attacker to predict or forge the signature.

Hashing: Explain how the file’s content is hashed, and this hash is what is signed. If the content is modified, the hash changes, which results in a failed verification.

Immutability of the Signature: Highlight how the signature is bound to the exact content of the file. If any part of the file changes, even a single character, the signature is no longer valid.

4. Visualizing the Attack:

To make it more visual:

Before Tampering: Show a screenshot of the file (test.txt) and the corresponding signature (signature.bin).

After Tampering: Show the modified test.txt file and try verifying it with the same signature. Display the "Signature verification failed" message.

You could also create a short demo showing this process on your app:

First screen: Display the file content and signature being generated.

Second screen: Show the modified content and the failed signature verification message.

Log output: Open the logs to display the failure details.

5. Wrap-up:

Conclude by stating how this algorithm prevents an attacker from tampering with files, as they wouldn’t be able to forge a valid signature without the private key, and any alteration would cause the signature verification to fail.

By demonstrating this, you show not only the integrity of the Lamport signature but also how your implementation helps in preventing such attacks.
