if i die in a war zone, 
box me up and send me home. 
Put my medals on my chest, 
Tell my mom i did my best. 
Tell my father not to bow, 
he won't get tension from me now. 
Tell my brother to study perfectly, 
keys of my bike will be his permanently. 
Tell my sis not to be upset, 
Her bro will not rise after this sunset, 
Tell my love not to Cry... 
'BECAUSE IAM A SOLDIER BORN TO DIE....! ! !
